# CubeSat Structural Panel – SolidWorks Project

## Description
This repository contains a beginner-level SolidWorks CAD project focused on designing a simple CubeSat structural panel. The project emphasizes correct modeling practices, clear dimensioning, material assignment, and basic engineering documentation.

This is my first step toward a long-term journey in aerospace and space exploration engineering.

---

## Objective
- Design a simple structural panel suitable for CubeSat applications
- Practice SolidWorks sketching, features, and constraints
- Learn how to document an engineering project using GitHub

---

## Design Decisions
- A rectangular panel was created as the base geometry.
- Four mounting holes were added at the corners using the Hole Wizard.
- Hole centers were positioned 10 mm from each edge for symmetry.
- Fillets were applied to the edges to reduce stress concentration.
- The model was kept fully parametric and editable.

---

## Material Choice
- Material: Aluminum 6061
- Reason:
  - Commonly used in aerospace structures
  - Good strength-to-weight ratio
  - Easy to machine and manufacture

Mass properties were evaluated after applying the material.

## Files Included
- `CubeSat_Panel.SLDPRT` – SolidWorks part file
- `images/isometric_view.png` – Isometric view of the panel
- `images/mass_properties.png` – Mass properties evaluation

---

## What I Learned
- Creating fully defined sketches in SolidWorks
- Using Hole Wizard for precise hole placement
- Dimensioning from edges correctly
- Applying materials and checking mass properties
- Organizing and documenting a CAD project on GitHub

---

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks (Student Version)
